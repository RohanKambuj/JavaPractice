Create a Circle class (without main method
which has following instance variables
radius as double 
color as String

it has two constructors 
- one accepts radius, color as parameter, and  
- one does not accept any parameters

It has the following methods
- getter and setter for radius(2)
- getter and setter for color (2)
- calculate the area (radius*radius*Math.PI)(1) this method
  returns area in type double

	
Then you create another class (having main method). CircleDemo
Inside this class,
- Create four objects of Circle and 
- provide different radius and color.
- Print radius, color and area of all the four circles on console.









Create a Cylinder class, inherit it from Circle
having "height" as additional attribute of type double
two constructors, 
- one with three parameters, radius,color and height and 
- other without any parameter

the following behaviours/methods
- setHeight() and getHeight()
- Override the getArea() method in Circle to implement area of the Cylinder
- getVolume() which internally calls getarea method of circle (height * area of circle)

- create another class having main method. 
Create 3 objects of Cylinder having different 
values of color, radius and height.
